1) Recognize various ways to make pitch engaging:


3) Cultural references to your audience:
    - Barack Obama referencing certain sandwich shop in location of his speech
      to make his audience feel like he's similar to them in that he goes to the same
      sandwich shop that they do.
    - Student with a time-tracking app making a joke about how Waka-time always breaks

===============================
Getting inspiration from others:
---------
1) Who are some of the most engaging speakers you know?
2) What makes them engaging?

Another way is to have a group discussion or debate where everyone is involved.
